# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## 📜 Project Overview
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on a variety of factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and other demographic information. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project provides insights into how these factors influence insurance charges, helping insurers and individuals better understand potential costs.

## 🚀 Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth visualization and analysis of the dataset to uncover trends and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identification of significant features to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Building:** Implementation of regression models for accurate prediction of insurance charges.
- **Evaluation:** Comprehensive model evaluation using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R².

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis and visualization

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:
- **Age:** Age of the individual
- **Sex:** Gender (male/female)
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index
- **Children:** Number of children covered by insurance
- **Smoker:** Whether the individual smokes (yes/no)
- **Region:** Residential region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
- **Charges:** Medical insurance charges (target variable)

Ensure you have access to the dataset in the `data` folder.

## 🧪 Results
- **Best Performing Model:** [Linear_Regression_Model with Accuracy_score]
